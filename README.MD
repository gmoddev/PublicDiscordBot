Description
# DiscordBot  

## ✨ Overview  
DiscordBot is a highly modular and permission‑aware Discord system built with **Discord.js v14**.  
It is designed to be **easy to extend**, **secure with permission checks**, and **simple to maintain** while providing a smooth experience for both developers and staff teams.

---

## ✅ Pros  

### ⚡ Modular Slash Command System  
- Commands are **auto‑loaded** from the `commands` and `cogs` folders.  
- New commands can be added by simply dropping a file in – **no core edits required**.  
- Supports both **single‑file commands** and **multi‑command cogs**.

---

### 🔐 Built‑In Permission Checks  
- Every command automatically goes through the `CanRunCommand` system.  
- Restrict usage to specific roles or ranks without touching command code.  
- Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive commands effortlessly.

---

### 📦 Cog‑Based Event Handling  
- Events are fully modular.  
- Cogs can register **multiple events** or single legacy events with minimal boilerplate.  
- Easy to scale as your bot grows in complexity.

---

### 🚀 Automatic Slash Command Registration  
- Slash commands are synced to Discord **on startup**.  
- No manual registration or separate scripts needed.  
- Keeps your commands always up‑to‑date with your code.

---

### 🛡️ Stability & Safety  
- Global error handlers for unhandled rejections and exceptions.  
- Clear logging for command loading, events, and runtime issues.  
- Reduces downtime and simplifies debugging.

---

### 🛠️ Developer Friendly  
- Organized project structure (`commands/`, `cogs/`, `helpers/`).  
- Built‑in helpers like `registerCommand` make it simple to expand.  
- `.env` support for safe and secure configuration.  
- Uses modern Discord.js features (GatewayIntents, Partials, Collections).

---

## 🌟 Summary  
This bot is built for teams that want a **powerful, flexible, and permission‑safe foundation**.  
You can easily add features, keep commands organized, and ensure only the right people can use them—all while benefiting from clean logging and stability safeguards.

> **Perfect for moderation systems, staff tools, or any project needing a reliable Discord backend.**
